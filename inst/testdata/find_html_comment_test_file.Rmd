## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

<!-- RMS This is a comment that I want to notice later. To help others see it,
 I decided to write more words than are needed.
-->

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- TJH When I see this I get to think of the best coworker ever.
-->

<!-- SRR When I see this I get to think of the best coworker ever. -->
<!-- I am not thinking of much here -->

This is more text

<!-- RMS 
Let's count this one
-->

<!--
RMS I am counting this too. -->


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
